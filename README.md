# [Project BlackBird: A Lightweight Cryptographic Application](https://pandukonala.github.io/blog-projects/blackbird/blackbird.html)

## Overview
> A lightweight cryptographic file encryption / decryption application. It utilizes symmetric key cryptographic algorithms such as AES, DES, Blowfish and RC4 present in 2016 java security standards. The application also generates a failsafe file which helps users remember the password with which they secured their files. Note: This is my very first project in computer science and apologises for any mistakes or UI errors.
